# crocodile clips

The large holes at the bottom of the board are designed to attach alligator/crocodile clips.
Register an event that will execute whenever the user attaches one side of the crocodile clip to the `GND` pin, then connects and disconnects the unattached side of the crocodile clip to pin `0`, `1`, or `2`.

### Example: on pin pressed with random numbers

This example displays a random number every time the crocodile clip holds  `GND` then connects and disconnects the `P0` pin. Each time the crocodile clip is firmly connected and disconnected from pin `P0`, the micro:bit will return a random Number between 0 and the parameter limit
